### Reflective Analysis      
This simple and easy 3D game is designed for children playing. I intended to make a 3D version of ‘Snake’ game to kids in order to have better visualization and interactivity of the game. However, I could not find a proper player element and enlarge the player when it collides with a cube, so I decided to create a new game that based on the ‘Snake’, which gaining one point when player collides with a cube, using Mapbox SDK to create 3D buildings as barriers that increase level of difficulty, floating cubes give players a sense of vivid world. 

The process of this game design is described as following. The first step was to download and import Mapbox SDK. After imported SDK files to Unity, selected the ‘location-based game’ since this example fulfilled every element that I want. After that, I changed the map style, player settings, camera setting, created a Canvas of players’ view and some GUI text boxes. Next step was to write some C# scripts to the player and cubes to add some interactivities. The final step was to build and run the game. 

I found these two tutorial videos are very helpful in my 3D game design, and those C# scripts that I used are from these videos.
